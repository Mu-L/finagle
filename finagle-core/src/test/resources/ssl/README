To generate a new certificate, from this (ssl) directory, run:

For test-ec-with-sans.crt:
$ openssl req -new -key keys/test-ec-key.pem -out request.csr -config conf/test-ec-with-sans.cnf
$ openssl x509 -req -days 1825 -in request.csr -signkey keys/test-ec-key.pem --out certs/test-ec-with-sans.crt -extensions v3_ca -extfile conf/test-ec-with-sans.cnf

For test-ecclient-with-sans.crt:
$ openssl req -new -key keys/test-ec-key.pem -out request.csr -config conf/test-ecclient-with-sans.cnf
$ openssl x509 -req -days 1825 -in request.csr -signkey keys/test-ec-key.pem --out certs/test-ecclient-with-sans.crt -extensions v3_ca -extfile conf/test-ecclient-with-sans.cnf
